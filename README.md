# Student Information project
### **Description**
The project name is "Student Information" and it is built using the ASP.NET MVC framework and Entity Framework. It implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database to manage student information.

### **Approach**
The project is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application's concerns into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic; the view, which represents the user interface; and the controller, which handles user input and manages communication between the model and view.

The Entity Framework is used to interact with the student database. This makes it easier to perform CRUD operations on the database without writing SQL queries directly.

### **Features**
Here's an overview of the project's main features:
```
Home page : The home page of the application displays a list of all the students in the database, along with options to create, edit, and delete students.

Create page: The create page allows users to add a new student to the database. Users can enter the Student's name, Student's City, and Student's Fees.

Edit page: The edit page allows users to update an existing student's information. Users can edit the Student's name, Student's City, and Student's Fees.

Delete functionality: The delete functionality allows users to remove a student from the database.

Details functionality: The details functionality allows users to display for a specific student details in the database by name.
